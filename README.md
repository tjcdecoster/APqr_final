# APqr_final
RTXI code that was used to produce opto-electronic dynamic patch-clamping data for real-time (re)shaping of cardiac action potentials.

This repository consists of four main software versions. Each of them describes an RTXI module (LINK TO RTXI) that has a different use case. The four modules are:
1) APqr7
2) APqr8
3) APqrPID3
4) APqrPIDLTLP4
